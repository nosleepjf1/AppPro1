I added code so that the responses tab now has the same form elements as the edit tab.
// DONE // I need to make the form elements read-only on the responses tab.
I added code to the retrieveformdata.php script that retrieves each submission id related to that form and then returns...
...the description from the set of rows from the first submission.
// DONE // display the row data from the first submission id in the responses tab. to do this i have to parse the data in script.js and then insert it
After I get this far, I will need to add next and previous buttons and update the data based on the position of the...
...submissions array in the retrieveformdata.php script

TODO I need to restrict people from submitting these characters (-,/,|) because i use them to separate data

data for text and numbers are now showing in response tab
data for checkbox are now showing as well (did not test extensively for possible bugs)

// DONE // admin.php lines 177-180 are where the left and right buttons are. I need to make it so these buttons navigate through submissions

// DONE //The cookie almost works perfectly. I just need to fix it so that when you change from one form to another it resets the cookie to 0
// DONE //I also need to update the left and right buttons so that they run a php request similar to retrieveformdata.php

TODO This has me stumped... I'll come back to it later - there is a bug where the checkboxes don't uncheck themselves based on the current submission being viewed.
