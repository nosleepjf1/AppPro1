I added code so that the responses tab now has the same form elements as the edit tab.
TODO I need to make the form elements read-only on the responses tab.
I added code to the retrieveformdata.php script that retrieves each submission id related to that form and then returns...
...the description from the set of rows from the first submission.
TODO display the row data from the first submission id in the responses tab. to do this i have to parse the data in script.js and then insert it
After I get this far, I will need to add next and previous buttons and update the data based on the position of the...
...submissions array in the retrieveformdata.php script


data for text and numbers are now showing in response tab
